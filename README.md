# pilat_2022_LDP-PR_reproducible-project
This is a repository for Hannah Pilat's Living Data Project Productivity and Reproducibility assignment. 
It contains R scripts that as of right now have terrible formatting.
This will be changed very soon, it was a fight to get git linked to Rstudio. It happened at 10:00 the night the assignment was due so code formatting can wait.
Although I might not sleep well until I fix my code...
Pray for me
