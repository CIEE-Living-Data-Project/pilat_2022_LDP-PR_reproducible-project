# pilat_2022_LDP-PR_reproducible-project
this is a repository for the Living Data Project Productivity and Reproducibility assignment
it contains R scripts that as of right now have terrible formatting
this will be changed very soon, it was a fight to get git linked to Rstudio. It happened at 10:00 the night the assignment was due so code formatting can wait.
although I might not sleep well until I fix my code
pray for me
